// tools in `tools[]`, because the parent's `--undo` cannot reverse a
// child's writes when checkpoints are off. `worktree` opts the child
// into a dedicated git worktree under `~/.cache/agent/worktrees/<id>/`;
// the writes-true gate is lifted there because the child's mutations
// land on a separate branch the parent can inspect, merge, or discard

// `dirty` is the post-run `git status --porcelain` verdict (true =
// any tracked or untracked diff). It drives the preserve/remove
// decision: clean → both worktree dir and agent branch dropped;

// `branch`. `preserved` and `removed` are mutually exclusive
// booleans, NOT a discriminated union, because the model reads
