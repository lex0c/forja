// Slice 161 (review — hot-path memoization). The matcher runs in the
// per-tool-call hot path. Spec budget is 5ms target / 15ms p95 per
// PERFORMANCE.md §X. Three pre-slice issues compounded:
//
//   1. `new Glob(pattern)` and `new RegExp(...)` constructed PER
//      CALL inside the matcher functions. With N rules in a policy
//      and one fs check, that's N×2 Glob constructions and N
//      RegExp compilations every time.
//   2. `realpathSync(target)` called inside `matchPath` itself, so
//      `firstMatchingPath` looping over N rules re-realpaths the
//      SAME target N times. On hot FS or large rule lists this
//      dominates the budget.
//   3. `resolve(cwd, pattern)` called per call even though the
//      pattern and cwd are static within a check.
//
// Fixes:
//   - Module-level Map caches for compiled Glob/RegExp keyed by the
//     literal pattern (path matcher) or by the resolved-relative
//     form (when cwd-dependent). Caches are bounded by the union
//     of distinct pattern strings the process sees (~policy size
//     × hot cwds; realistic ceiling < few hundred entries).
//   - `prepareTarget(target, cwd)` resolves + canonicalizes ONCE
//     per check; `matchPathPrepared(pattern, prepared)` consumes
//     the prepared form without re-resolving. `firstMatchingPath`
//     uses this internally so the realpath cost is paid once
//     instead of N times.
//   - `matchPath(pattern, target, cwd)` stays as a public wrapper
//     for callers (tests + isolated matcher uses) that don't have
//     a hot loop. Production fs decision paths in `engine.ts`
//     route through `firstMatchingPath` directly.

//
// Output redirection matters specifically because the init

// Bash redirection turns any of those into silent file mutation:
// `git status --short > /tmp/secrets` matches `git status -*`

// extension `&>` / `&>>` (both streams to file), and the bash
// LEGACY form `>&word` where word is not a digit or `-`

// the digit/`-` discrimination). Stdin redirection from a file
// (`<FILE`, `<<EOF`, `<<<X`) does not mutate the filesystem
// and is not flagged on its own — those are the same risk class
// as the allowed host command reading stdin, which the bash
// allow rule already authorized.
//
// File-descriptor manipulation that does NOT touch the filesystem
// stays unflagged: `>&N`, `<&N`, `>&-`, `<&-`, `2>&1`, etc. The
// `>`/`<` branch consumes the trailing `&` so the digit/`-`
// target scans normally.
//
// Newline handling matters specifically because the matcher's
// glob compiler enables `s` (dotAll) so allow patterns like
// `bash -c *` work against multi-line scripts — but that same
// dotAll lets `git status -s\nrm -rf /tmp/pwn` match against an
// allow like `git status -*`. Bash treats `\n` as a command
// terminator equivalent to `;`, so we must too. `\r` is treated
// the same way conservatively: rare in agent-emitted commands,
// but a CR-only or CRLF input shouldn't slip past the gate just
// because the OS line-ending happens to be exotic.
//
// Lone `&` is bash's async control operator — `cmd1 & cmd2` runs
// cmd1 in background and immediately starts cmd2, so structurally
// it's a compound separator just like `;`.
//
// The scan respects single-quote, double-quote, and backslash-escape
// state so a literal `;` inside `git commit -m "fix; bug"` does not
// trip the detector. Newlines inside single/double quotes also
// don't trip — bash treats them as part of the string, not as
// terminators. A backslash before newline (`\\\n`) is the standard
// line-continuation; the scanner's escape rule skips the newline,
// correctly leaving the joined command undetected. Heuristic —
// does NOT model here-doc bodies (the body content scans
// normally and may flag on its own metachars) or `((...))`
// arithmetic substitution. These are rare in agent-emitted
// commands; if they show up the operator still sees the modal
// whenever a more common metachar fires.
//
// Returns true on any of the metachars listed above; the caller
// (engine.ts checkBash) treats true as "force confirm" — deny
// rules still win over confirm, so dangerous compounds like
// `; rm -rf /` are caught by `rm -rf /*` deny on the literal
// command before this gate runs.
